# Weather Node Application


Small NodeJS application that allows you to input location for a forecast response.

Created from NodeJS Udemy tutorial by Andrew Mead.

Application allowed me to learn how to develop async applications, setup web servers and the client side internals, create and wire up APIs, and various other things.

Amazing experience! As always, "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."

Application exists inside the web-server folder. 



### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd weather-app/web-server
$ npm install
$ cd ..
$ npm run start
```
